# Python-file-handling
## File Read & Write Challenge 

This Python program demonstrates how to:
- Read a file from user input
- Handle errors (like file not found)
- Modify the content
- Write the modified content to a new file

## Features
- Asks the user for a filename to read
- Handles `FileNotFoundError` and `IOError`
- Modifies file content (e.g., converts it to uppercase)
- Writes the result to a new file named `modified_<original_filename>`


## How to Use

1. Clone the repo or copy the script.
2. Create a file named `example.txt` in the same directory.
3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python file_handling.py
```
4. Enter `input.txt` when prompted.
5. A new file `modified_input.txt` will be created with modified content.
